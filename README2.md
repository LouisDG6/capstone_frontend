## Challenges

- I started this project attempting to use django for the backend framework. I messed up the routes and decided to start over using masonite. 
- There was a validation and logging error with runing console on heroku for masonite
- Tailwind would stop displaying after page load refresh
- White space on the bottom of the page with UIKIT
